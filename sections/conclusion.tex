\section{Conclusion}

	\paragraph{Use Meta Heuristics}
	Domain context:
		if it's needed a quickly response (think about a user using a CAD/CAM);
		if the cycle of update on the PCB files is fast, it's better to use a Meta Heuristics method.
		If the company don't produce huge amount of a single board.
		
	\paragraph{Use Exact Method}
		Instead if the number of boards produced s huge and the production continue for long period in that case is better to invest time and resources in order to get the optimal solution with an exact method.
