\subsection{Comparison of results}

	Obviously the time of Local search is not comparable to the Exact Method and since I set a fixed time for Tabu Seach is useless to compare the CPU time between the algorithms used.
	
	Check the differences between the results is much more interesting, figures \ref{fig:comparison} and \ref{fig:fb80-comparison}. We can say that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Local Search is the fastest methods.
		\item Tabu Search in almost all cases found the optimal solution or a solution near to optimum;
		\item In general the Tabu Search is better than the Local Search but we need to consider that it requires much more time, 30 seconds versus some milliseconds;
		\item Local Search performs worse for instances with a lot of nodes.
	\end{itemize}
