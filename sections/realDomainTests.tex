	In order to have a better idea of the quality of the methods previously show I test them with real instance. These instances are taken from the gerber files avaiable from the following online archive:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/tools/cad-layout/gerber/ ;
		\item https://www.microchip.com/doclisting/TechDoc.aspx?type=Gerber ;
	\end{itemize}
