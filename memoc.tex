	In this report is summarized the tests and the results obtained from the development of two programs. These programs solve a Travelling Sales Problem with, respectively, an exact method (using CPLEX library) and Meta Heuristic methods. The programs were a project assignment of the course Methods and Models for Combinatorial Optimization.
